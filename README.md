## Description
[Budget Tracker](https://blooming-falls-14765.herokuapp.com/) is a web application designed to track increments and decrements of funds. Users can easily add and subtract funds which allows them to view a graph of all of their expenses as well as the total money they have left to spend. The magic of this application is the fact that it can be used online *and* offline by using IndexedDB.
